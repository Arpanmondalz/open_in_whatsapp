# OPEN IN WHATSAPP

A simple web tool to **open phone numbers in WhatsApp without saving them as contacts**. 🔗  
Enter a phone number, hit “Open”, and WhatsApp opens directly — no need to save to your address book first.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Sometimes you just want to message a number once — perhaps a business, a temporary contact, or someone new — but you don’t want to clutter your contacts list.  
This project makes that easy by using WhatsApp’s “click to chat” functionality to open a chat without saving the number.  

## 🚀 Live Demo

[https://open-in-whatsapp-drab.vercel.app](https://open-in-whatsapp-drab.vercel.app) — try it out immediately in your browser.

## ⚙️ How It Works / What's Included

- A minimal HTML + JS frontend (see `index.html`) to input phone number and redirect using WhatsApp’s `wa.me` / “click-to-chat” link format.  
- No backend, no APIs, no storage — purely client-side.  
- Browser-compatible, works on desktop and mobile (with WhatsApp installed).  

## 🧰 Usage

1. Open the live demo link (or host your own copy).  
2. Enter an international phone number (including country code, e.g. `+91 9876543210`).  
3. Click **Open** → you will be redirected to WhatsApp chat with that number.  

*(Optionally: you can host the project yourself by simply opening `index.html` in any static-file server.)*
